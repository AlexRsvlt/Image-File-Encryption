# Image File Encryption

This code is an based on the AES encryption algorithm in CBC mode.The program creates an encrypted and a decrypted file of the original image file. The process includes reading the file, converting it to base64, encrypting it, saving the encrypted file, decrypting it, and finally saving the decrypted file.

AES algorithm:
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm used to secure data by encrypting it in fixed-size blocks of 128 bits. It supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, offering various levels of security. AES operates through multiple rounds of processing, involving substitution, permutation, and mixing of the data. Known for its high security and efficiency, AES is used globally by governments, financial institutions, and various software applications to protect sensitive information.
